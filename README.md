# Overview

This repo holds various versions of my resume.

The `general-resume` folder should contain the most recent
version of my resume.

## Daily Application Status

Starting on 9/27/25, I will be applying to one new position every day
until I get a job.

**I will not use AI in any of my resumes or cover letters from here on out.**
I would rather show that a human is applying to these positions rather than
a bot.

## Resume Count

If you want to see how many resumes I've created, `cargo run` and go to `127.0.0.1:8080`.

This was just an excuse to learn a bit about yew and actix web.
