# Overview

This repo holds various versions of my resume.

The `general-resume` folder should contain the most recent
version of my resume.

## Daily Application Status

Starting on 9/27/25, I will be applying to one new position every day
until I get a job.

**I will not use AI in any of my resumes or cover letters from here on out.**
I would rather show that a human is applying to these positions instead of AI slop.

## Resume Count

There are two methods to see how many resumes are in this repo:

1) Go to [brokenglass.dev/resume/](brokenglass.dev/resume/)

2) clone the repo, `cargo run`, go to `127.0.0.1:8080`
